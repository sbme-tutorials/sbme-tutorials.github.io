## Objectives

* Learn how to manage your project.
* Use *CMake* as a modern build system: high level and cross-platform.
* Use bitbucket for creating private repositories.

## Introduction to [CMake](https://cmake.org/)

<a href="https://cmake.org/"><img src="/gallery/Cmake.svg" style="width:60%;"></a>

[CMake](https://cmake.org/) is set of tools used to automate laborious tasks, for example:

* Building (i.e compiling) your executables.
* Building libraries to be used in further projects.
* Testing your applications.

We can also make use of CMake to have a well-designed project hierarchy; it is a good practice to seperate your project files and folders into different parts:

1. Application files (i.e those that contain `main` functions).
1. Library files. So far, our libraries are regarded as *Header-only* libraries, i.e our algorithms and data structures are all contained in `.hpp` files.
1. Datasets: it is a good practice to keep them isolated.
1. Build files: from now on, we will generate our build files and executables in a separate folder.

The application files typically `#include` the library files. However, they are living in different folders, so we will describe a little about our project structure in the *CMake* script files. *CMake* script files have always a unique name, `CMakeLists.txt`.

## An introductory tutorial on using CMake

### Installation

First, you need to install the *CMake* program, using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install cmake
```

### Life before CMake

Consider this [repository](https://github.com/sbme-tutorials/sbe201-revision-demo), clone by the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sbme-tutorials/sbe201-revision-demo.git
```

You have the following headers and source files:

| File | Type | Contents |
|-----|------|-------|
| int_dlinkedlist.hpp | header-only library | doubly-LL of integers |
| int_linkedlist.hpp | header-only library | singly-LL of integers |
| int_q_array.hpp | header-only library | Queue of integers using Array |
| int_q_linkedlist.hpp | header-only library |  Queue of integers using LL |
| test_int_dlinkedlist.cpp | C++ source file w/ `main` function | `main` function to test doubly-LL of integers |
| test_int_linkedlist.cpp | C++ source file w/ `main` function | `main` function to test singly-LL of integers |
| test_int_q_array.cpp | C++ source file w/ `main` function | `main` function to test Queue of integers using Array |
| test_int_q_linkedlist.cpp | C++ source file w/ `main` function | `main` function to test Queue of integers using LL |

Consider the case when we are still in development phase, so each time we need to compile all source files by issuing the following commands:

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -Wall test_int_dlinkedlist.cpp -o test_linkedlist
g++ -std=c++11 -Wall test_int_linkedlist.cpp -o test_linkedlist
g++ -std=c++11 -Wall test_int_q_array.cpp -o test_linkedlist
g++ -std=c++11 -Wall test_int_q_linkedlist.cpp -o test_linkedlist
```

![compiling](/gallery/compiling.png)

It becomes a cumbersome task to build your project when you have a lot of applications. We also may realize also how confusing to have all source files, headers files, and the compiled files in the same place.

To address the aforementioned issues, we will:

1. Organize our project into subdirectories.
1. Write *CMake* script file that describes the skeleton of our project. So from now on, we build and compile all applications with a single-word command.

### Organizing the project

Make the following directories:

1. `include`: to contain all the header-only libraries.
1. `apps`: to contain all the C++ source files.
1. `build`: to isolate our generated executables.

```bash
mkdir include
mkdir apps
mkdir build
```

Then move the corresponding files to their new subdirectories.

```bash
mv *.hpp include/
mv *.cpp apps/
```

> *Note that in a lot of bash commands you can use asterisk to match specific patterns of files. For example, `mv *.hpp include/` will move all files ending with `.hpp` to the `include` folder.*

Now we obtain the following directories and files:

```
├── apps
│   ├── test_int_dlinkedlist.cpp
│   ├── test_int_linkedlist.cpp
│   ├── test_int_q_array.cpp
│   └── test_int_q_linkedlist.cpp
├── build
├── include
│   ├── int_dlinkedlist.hpp
│   ├── int_linkedlist.hpp
│   ├── int_q_array.hpp
│   └── int_q_linkedlist.hpp
├── issue.png
└── README.md
```

### Our first CMake script

Create a new text file and name it `CMakeLists.txt`. *CMake* script files should be uniquely named `CMakeLists.txt`.

In the `CMakeLists.txt` file add the following lines:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5 )

### c++11 standards
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
set(CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS OFF)

project( batman )
```

those five lines are *boilerplate* code; we didn't yet describe the structure of our project. We are just:

1. [`cmake_minimum_required`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/cmake_minimum_required.html) to specify a minumum *cmake* version to run this script. This is used to maintain compatibility.
1. setting some first-class-citezen variables to declare our usage of the modern C++11 standard. The [`set`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.11/command/set.html) takes two parameters seperated by a space. The first parameter is the variable name, while the second parameter is the value of that variable. Further and advanced details about CMake native variables at [CMake useful variables](https://cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_Useful_Variables). You can also make custom variables to be used and referred in different parts of *CMake* script. For this small task, we won't need to make custom variables in the CMake script.
1. [`project`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/project.html) here we give a name to our project.

Afterwards, let's define the structure of our project by the following lines:

```cmake
include_directories( include )

add_executable( test_dll apps/test_int_dlinkedlist.cpp )
add_executable( test_sll apps/test_int_linkedlist.cpp )
add_executable( test_qarray apps/test_int_q_array.cpp )
add_executable( test_qll apps/test_int_q_linkedlist.cpp )
```

1. [`include_directory`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.11/command/include_directories.html) cmake function takes multiple parameters. Here we introduced only `include` as a parameter. This command allows the project C++ source files to include any header file in the `include` directory. However, the source files and header files are still seperated and living in different locations.
1. [`add_executable`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_executable.html) cmake function takes two parameters: the executable (target) name, and the corresponding `.cpp` file to compile.

### Life after CMake

Now go to the `build` folder and let the *cmake* program installed on your machine to run the `CMakeLists.txt` file that lives in the upper directory:

```bash
cd build
cmake ..
```

![cmake1](/gallery/cmake1.png)

Now, from now on, build everything with a single command:

```bash
make
```

![cmake2](/gallery/cmake2.png)

Now, after a fancy build progress log is finished, you will realize your executables are generated in the `build` directory.

![sloth](/gallery/knowledge-is-power.jpeg)

**NEVER add the build directory to the repository.** It is pointless having your generated files on the remote repository. Only provide your codes, data, and the CMake scripts.

## The final individual task

* You are required to gather all your works in the course tasks in a single project.
* Organize your project into four directories: `include`, `apps`, `data`, and `build`.
* You need to push your project on a repository at **bitbucket**, not github, until further notice.

### Project Hierarchy

#### Header Files

Make a folder to contain all your header files naming it `include`.

```bash
mkdir include
```

Copy header files (i.e `.hpp` files) you have developed throughout the course, and rename any files like `member1.hpp` to representative name (e.g `stack_ll.hpp`).

#### Source Files

Make a folder to contain all your source files (i.e those that contain a `main` function)

```bash
mkdir apps
```

Copy the source files (i.e `.cpp` files) associated with your tasks in `apps` folder.

#### Data Files

Keep your datasets in a seperate folder `data`.

```bash
mkdir data
```

#### Build Files

When building your application, you need to isolate the generated files and executable away from the source code; create a dedicated folder for build files.

```bash
mkdir build
```

#### Expected Issue: Helpers Header File

It is expected to have an issue regarding the `helpers.hpp` file that is provided in multiple tasks. You will need to rename the `helpers.hpp` files in each task with a suffix number. For example, for the first task you are provided `helpers.hpp`, rename it to `helpers1.hpp`, and the next task you provided the `helpers.hpp`, rename it to `helpers2.hpp`, and so on.

#### Expected Issue: Conflicting Repositories

Make sure to copy the files inside the repository folder of each task, **don't copy the whole folder, because this will copy the meta-data associdated with each repository.** If you insist to copy the repositories as they are, then, after copying to the new big folder, you need to remove the `.git` folder accompanied with each copied repository. Again, it is better to copy the files in those repositories, but not copying the repository.
