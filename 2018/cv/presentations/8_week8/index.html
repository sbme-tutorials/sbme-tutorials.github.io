## Clustering Segmentation 

* Clustering is grouping of similar 

* Machine learning, Data analysis and Data mining. 

* Segmentation is as a clustering problem.

## Feature Space
* Feature
    * Identifies characteristic of subject
    
    * Must discriminate different subjects.
    
    * Good feature vs robust classifier. 

* Feature space is an alternative space 

* Coordinates are values of features.

## Feature Space cont'd 
* For example, color as a feature 

* Coordinates will be  R, G, and B.

## K means Clustering

* K is number of clusters 

* Assumes spherical clusters

* Sensitive to outliers

## Basic Algorithm
```python
Construct feature space from your image (number of data point = number of pixels)
Set number of required clusters k 
Set Max number of iterations for clustering
Get random k points in your feature space (initial centers)
for i in range(max number of iterations)
    #Cluster remaining data points to centers according to distance
    for each data point:
        for each cluster:
            distances =  distance between it cluster centers
        its cluster = min(distances)
    #Calculate the new centers 
    for each cluster:
        newCenter = mean(RelatedPoints)
```

## Mean shift Clustering

* Non-parametric technique for clustering.

* Robust and not sensitive to outliers 

* Clusters take a none-linear shape.

### Basic algorithm 
Pseudo code of basic mean shift algorithm with uniform kernel 

```python 
Extract feature space from image
While number of unvisited points > 0
    Select a random point in feature space (Initial mean)
    While true: 
    Get distance between mean and all points in feature space
    For uniform window, select points in the range of specified bandwidth and track that points
    Get the new mean, it is the mean of points within bandwidth
    if distance between new and old means < threshold:
        cluster all tracked points to new mean 
        update number of visited points 
        break
```

### Merging clusters

* For uniform kernel center may not move 

* Merging is the solution.

* Distance between the two centers < 0.5 bandwidth.

```python 
Extract feature space from image
While number of unvisited points > 0
    Select a random point in feature space (Initial mean)
    While true: 
    Get distance between mean and all points in feature space
    For uniform window, select points in the range of specified bandwidth and track that points
    Get the new mean, it is the mean of points within bandwidth
    if distance between new and old means < threshold:
        for c in clusters:
            #Check merge condition
            if distance(c, center) < 0.5* Bandwidth:
                mean of cluster c = 0.5*distance(c,center)
                cluster all tracked points to cluster c
        #No merge
        cluster all tracked points to new mean 
        #Update visited points
        update number of visited points 
        break
```

### Bandwidth selection 

* Larger bandwidth lower number of clusters

* Smaller bandwidth more number of clusters.
